## Hi, I am Mayara :vulcan_salute: 👩‍💻 


I am an electrical engineer since 2019. In 2021, I started to study programming language. Between logic and languages, I find myself in a world where we try to be better than ourselves every day.

#### What am I focusing on?
I am currently learning Python.

#### A thought:
