# Hello everyone, I am Mayara! ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81026124/113754724-e646aa00-96e5-11eb-8cf4-ba107797b98a.png)

I am an electrical engineer since 2019. In 2021, I started to study programming language. Between logic and languages, I find myself in a world where we try to be better than ourselves every day.

What am I focusing on?
I am currently learning Python.
